// Root-level Vitest config for options that must be global across the
// workspace: coverage aggregation and thresholds, plus the list of per-project
// configs. Vitest 4 replaced the standalone `vitest.workspace.*` file with the
// inline `projects` array here — per-project test behavior (environment,
// resolve aliases, setup files) still lives in each package's vitest.config.ts.
//
// Coverage thresholds are the BASELINE we currently achieve (DEVX-100 was
// scoped as "infrastructure + baseline tests"). The ratcheting plan lives in
// DEVX-102 (the 95%-coverage follow-up Story) — bump each threshold +5% per
// PR there until all sit >= 95%.
